Utilities for working with pogigwasc
====================================

Scripts to help prepare data for the pogigwasc gene predictor, and to reformat
or process output files.

[pogigwasc](https://github.com/Swart-lab/pogigwasc) is a gene predictor for
eukaryotic genomes with ambiguous stop codons, developed by David Vetter.

TODO:
 * Split scaffolds into contigs at Ns and recombine the output GFF3 file coordinates where necessary
 * Estimate model parameters from training data - standalone script
 * Empirical correction of mispredicted introns from RNAseq data
